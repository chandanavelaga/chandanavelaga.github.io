Me and Sam in the car, talking 'bout America
Heading to the wishing well, we've reached our last resort
I turned to him said, "Man help me out
I fear I'm on an island in an ocean full of change
Can't bring myself to dive in to an ocean full of change
Am I losing touch
Am I losing touch now?"
He said, "Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to overthinking and
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to second guessing" and
Hey pretty smiling people
We're alright together, we're alright together
Hey pretty shining people
We're alright together, we're alright together, hey
Took it in turns to dream about the lottery
And what we might have done if we had entered and had won
We're each convinced that nothing would have changed
But if this were the case, why is it a conversation anyway?
Are we losing touch?
Are we losing touch now?
He said, "Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to over thinking and
Why why, what a terrible time to be alive
If you're prone to second guessing" and
Hey pretty smiling people
We're alright together, we're alright together
Hey pretty shining people
We're alright together, we're alright together
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Don't we all need love?
The answer is easy
Hey pretty smiling people
We're alright together, we're alright together
Hey pretty shining people
We're alright together, we're alright together
Hey pretty smiling people
We're alright together, we're alright together
Hey pretty shining people
We're alright together, we're alright together, hey
